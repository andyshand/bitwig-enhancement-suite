### Extra Configurable Shortcuts

- Play selected notes
- Close all plugin windows
- Tile plugin windows
- Collapse/expand devices
- Navigate browser tabs
- Clear browser filters
- Track back/forward navigation
- And many more!

### Optional Workflow Features

- Middle click to play from anywhere in the arranger view
- Remember scroll position for device view when switching tracks
- Exclusive-arm
- Allow middle click drag when VST windows are focused
- And more!

### VST Pass-through for Shortcuts

With Modwig, all shortcuts can trigger whether VST windows are focused or not.

### Create Custom Macros

Combine all available actions and shortcuts into your own macros using simple Javascript. For example, add a track, open device browser, type "EQ" and hit enter. See [the wiki](https://github.com/andyshand/modwig/wiki/Creating-a-Custom-Mod#running-other-actions-macros) for details.

# Setup

Please note Modwig is currently Mac only, quite unstable and should probably only be used if you're a developer and can afford to troubleshoot issues. See https://github.com/andyshand/modwig/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md for developer setup instructions, or ask questions at the [discord](https://discord.com/invite/6Wetp3ZsKv).

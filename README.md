# Modwig (In Early Development)

Modwig adds helpful keyboard shortcuts and extra features to Bitwig Studio.

### Extra Configurable Shortcuts

- Play selected notes
- Close all plugin windows
- Tile plugin windows
- Collapse/expand devices
- Navigate browser tabs
- Clear browser filters
- Track back/forward navigation
- And many more!

### Optional Workflow Features

- Middle click to play from anywhere in the arranger view
- Remember scroll position for device view when switching tracks
- Exclusive-arm
- Allow middle click drag when VST windows are focused
- And more!

### VST Pass-through for Shortcuts

By default, Bitwig blocks certain shortcuts from working when VST windows are focused. With Modwig, you can bypass this and allow any shortcut to work when you expect.

### Create Custom Macros

Combine all available actions and shortcuts into your own macros using simple Javascript. For example, add a track, open device browser, type "EQ" and hit enter. See [the wiki](https://github.com/andyshand/modwig/wiki/Creating-a-Custom-Mod#running-other-actions-macros) for details.

# Setup

Please note Modwig is currently quite unstable and should probably only be used if you're a developer and can afford to troubleshoot issues. See https://github.com/andyshand/modwig/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md for developer setup instructions, or ask questions at the [discord](https://discord.com/invite/6Wetp3ZsKv).

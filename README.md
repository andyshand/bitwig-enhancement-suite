# Modwig (In Early Development, Experimental!) 

Modwig adds helpful keyboard shortcuts and extra features to Bitwig Studio.

### Extra Configurable Shortcuts

- Play selected notes
- Close all plugin windows
- Tile plugin windows
- Collapse/expand devices
- Navigate browser tabs
- Clear browser filters
- Track back/forward navigation
- And many more!

### Optional Workflow Features

- Middle click to play from anywhere in the arranger view
- Remember scroll position for device view when switching tracks
- Exclusive-arm
- Allow middle click drag when VST windows are focused
- And more!

### VST Pass-through for Shortcuts

By default, Bitwig blocks certain shortcuts from working when VST windows are focused. With Modwig, you can bypass this and allow any shortcut to work when you expect.

### Create Custom Macros

Combine all available actions and shortcuts into your own macros using simple Javascript. For example, add a track, open device browser, type "EQ" and hit enter. See [the wiki](https://github.com/andyshand/modwig/wiki/Creating-a-Custom-Mod#running-other-actions-macros) for details.

# Setup

Disclaimer: please note modwig is currently Mac only and in early development. Although far from production ready, I am using it successfully every day without many issues, only occassionally restarting. YMMV of course!

1. Download the latest version of the app from the [releases tab](https://github.com/andyshand/modwig/releases) and copy it to your Applications folder.

2. Open Modwig and follow the guided setup process. The app is unsigned, so you may get a warning from macOS and go to your "Security & Privacy" settings and click "Open Anyway".

A general overview of Modwig's functionality can be found [in the wiki](https://github.com/andyshand/modwig/wiki/Overview).
